Players perform it by using the exterior of their dominant foot to push the ball towards their dominant side, then quickly move the dominant foot around the ball and uses its interior to push the ball to their non-dominant side.</p>

So the ball goes behind the front leg while you jump towards the ball. Taking off with the right foot. Hitting the ball with the inside of the foot while the left leg is kind of swinging around the ball.</p>

                     <p>A bicycle kick, also known as an overhead kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg in front of the other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity and uncommon performance in competitive football matches makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.</p>
